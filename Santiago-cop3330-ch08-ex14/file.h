// It is possible to declare a non reference function with const
// This means that a the value the function recieves cannot be changed within the function
// One might want to do this if they wanted to make sure they didnt change the value they were given, though this is inefficient as c++ passes by value, rather than reference, so the actual variable wouldnt change anyway
// One also loses the utility of changing a value in a function, and runs the risk of compilation errors.
